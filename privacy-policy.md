## Introduction

EV Charging Tracker ("we", "our", or "the app") is committed to protecting your privacy. This Privacy Policy explains how we collect, use, and safeguard your information when you use our iOS application.

## Information We Collect

### Information You Provide

When you use EV Charging Tracker, you may provide the following information:

- **Charging Session Data**: Date, time, location, duration, and cost of charging sessions
- **Vehicle Information**: Vehicle model, battery capacity, and related specifications
- **Expense Records**: Charging costs, maintenance expenses, and other vehicle-related financial data
- **Notes and Custom Data**: Any personal notes or custom information you choose to add to your records

### Automatically Collected Information

- **Location Data**: If you enable location services, we may collect location information to automatically log charging locations
- **Usage Data**: Information about how you use the app, including features accessed and app performance data
- **Device Information**: Device type, operating system version, and app version

## How We Use Your Information

We use the collected information to:

- Provide core app functionality for tracking charging sessions and expenses
- Generate reports and analytics about your charging history and costs
- Improve app performance and user experience
- Calculate statistics such as cost per charge, total expenses, and charging patterns

## Data Storage

All your personal data (charging sessions, vehicle information, expenses) is stored locally on your device. We do not transfer your personal data to external servers.

## iCloud Backup

EV Charging Tracker offers iCloud backup functionality to help you safeguard your data and sync it across your Apple devices. When you enable iCloud backup in the app:

- Your charging sessions, vehicle data, and expense records are backed up to your personal iCloud account
- Backups are encrypted by Apple and protected by your Apple ID
- Data is accessible only through your iCloud account
- Backup and sync is subject to [Apple's Privacy Policy](https://www.apple.com/legal/privacy/)

You can enable or disable iCloud backup at any time in the app settings. If disabled, all data remains stored locally on your device only.

## Location Services

If you grant location permissions, we use your location data to:

- Automatically tag charging sessions with location information
- Help you identify where you charged your vehicle

You can revoke location permissions at any time through your device settings. The app will continue to function without location services, but you'll need to manually enter location information if desired.

## Analytics

We use Google Analytics to collect anonymous usage data to help us understand how the app is used and improve the user experience. This includes:

- **App usage patterns**: Which features are used, screen views, and user interactions
- **Device information**: Device type, operating system version, and app version
- **Performance data**: App launch times, crashes, and errors

Google Analytics data is:

- Anonymous and does not include your personal charging data, vehicle information, or expense records
- Processed by Google in accordance with [Google's Privacy Policy](https://policies.google.com/privacy)
- Used solely to improve app functionality and user experience

You can limit ad tracking and analytics collection through your device's privacy settings (Settings > Privacy & Security > Tracking).

## Data Sharing and Third Parties

We do not sell, trade, or transfer your personal information to third parties. Your personal data (charging sessions, expenses, vehicle information) remains on your device and in your personal iCloud account (if enabled).

We share anonymous usage data with Google Analytics as described above to improve the app.

## Data Security

We implement appropriate technical measures to protect your data:

- All data is stored locally on your device using iOS secure storage mechanisms
- No data transmission to external servers
- Data is protected by your device's built-in security features

## Your Rights and Choices

You have the right to:

- **Access Your Data**: All your data is accessible within the app
- **Delete Your Data**: You can delete individual records or all data through the app settings
- **Export Your Data**: You can export your charging history and expense data from the app
- **Disable Location Services**: You can revoke location permissions at any time

## Children's Privacy

EV Charging Tracker is not intended for use by children under the age of 13. We do not knowingly collect personal information from children under 13.

## Changes to This Privacy Policy

We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. We will notify you of any changes by:

- Posting the new Privacy Policy in the app
- Updating the "Last Updated" date at the top of this policy

Your continued use of the app after changes are posted constitutes acceptance of the updated policy.

## Data Retention

Data is retained on your device until you manually delete it. We do not have access to your data and therefore do not control retention periods.

## International Users

Since all data is stored locally on your device, no cross-border data transfers occur. Your data remains in your physical possession.
