## Data Storage

All your personal data (expenses, categories, notes) is stored locally on your device. We do not transfer your personal data to external servers.

## iCloud Backup

Journey Wallet offers iCloud backup functionality to help you safeguard your data and sync it across your Apple devices. When you enable iCloud backup in the app:

- Backups are encrypted by Apple and protected by your Apple ID
- Data is accessible only through your iCloud account
- Backup and sync is subject to [Apple's Privacy Policy](https://www.apple.com/legal/privacy/)

You can enable or disable iCloud backup at any time in the app settings. If disabled, all data remains stored locally on your device only.

## Location Services

Journey Wallet does not use location services.

## Analytics

We use Google Analytics to collect anonymous usage data to help us understand how the app is used and improve the user experience. This includes:

- **App usage patterns**: Which features are used, screen views, and user interactions
- **Device information**: Device type, operating system version, and app version
- **Performance data**: App launch times, crashes, and errors

Google Analytics data is:

- Anonymous and does not include your personal charging data, vehicle information, or expense records
- Processed by Google in accordance with [Google's Privacy Policy](https://policies.google.com/privacy)
- Used solely to improve app functionality and user experience

You can limit ad tracking and analytics collection through your device's privacy settings (Settings > Privacy & Security > Tracking).

We do not sell, trade, or transfer your personal information to third parties. Your personal data (expenses, categories, notes) remains on your device and in your personal iCloud account (if enabled).

We share anonymous usage data with Google Analytics as described above to improve the app.

## Data Security

We implement appropriate technical measures to protect your data:

- All data is stored locally on your device using iOS secure storage mechanisms

## Changes to This Privacy Policy

We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. We will notify you of any changes by:

- Posting the new Privacy Policy in the app
- Updating the "Last Updated" date at the top of this policy

Your continued use of the app after changes are posted constitutes acceptance of the updated policy.

## Data Retention

Data is retained on your device until you manually delete it. We do not have access to your data and therefore do not control retention periods.
