- Backups are encrypted by Apple and protected by your Apple ID

You can enable or disable iCloud backup at any time in the app settings. If disabled, all data remains stored locally on your device only.

Journey Wallet allows you to export your data in JSON format and import data from JSON files. When you export:

- All journey data and related entities are included in the export file
- The export file is saved to a location you choose
- You control who has access to the exported file

## Location Services

Journey Wallet does not use location services.

## Analytics

We use Firebase Analytics to collect anonymous usage data to help us understand how the app is used and improve the user experience. This includes:

- **App usage patterns**: Which features are used, screen views, and user interactions
- **Device information**: Device type, operating system version, and app version
- **Performance data**: App launch times, crashes, and errors

Analytics data is:

- Anonymous and does not include your personal travel data, booking information, documents, or expense records

- Used solely to improve app functionality and user experience

You can limit ad tracking and analytics collection through your device's privacy settings (Settings > Privacy & Security > Tracking).

## Notifications

Journey Wallet uses local notifications for reminders you create. These notifications:

- Are processed entirely on your device
- Do not transmit any data to external servers

## Data Sharing and Third Parties

We do not sell, trade, or transfer your personal information to third parties. Your personal data (journeys, bookings, documents, expenses, etc.) remains on your device and in your personal iCloud account (if enabled).

We share anonymous usage data with Firebase Analytics as described above to improve the app.

## Data Security

We implement appropriate technical measures to protect your data:
